        <h2>Ethereum 2.0 Epochs</h2>
        <p>With hundreds of thousands of users using various features from dapps to NFTs, the Ethereum network is being upgraded as a means of devising a lasting solution, called the ETH 2.0, to solve the Ethereum blockchain's scalability challenge.</p>
        <p>The Ethereum block explorer shows current updates on various activities within the network. These data are shown in the form of attestations, slots, and epochs.</p>
        <p>Epoch is one concept that is very important to the Ethereum 2.0 explorer, and we will see what it means in a while. </p>
        <h2>Understanding Epochs</h2>
        <p>Epochs are generally time frames within a blockchain. These time frames determine the order in which certain activities take place -- activities such as, paying out rewards or changing a set of validators to validate transactions. </p>
        <p>Epochs are also understood as the time span for finalizing a specific number of blocks on the blockchain. Different blockchain protocols have their epoch specifications. </p>
        <h2>What Is An Epoch In Ethereum?</h2>
        <p>For Bitcoin and the Ethereum Mainnet, progress on the network is recorded in blocks, but for Ethereum 2.0, it is recorded in epochs. Ethereum epoch is the unit of time â€” and time in ETH 2.0 is divided into slots. </p>
        <p>A slot is 12 seconds, and an Ethereum epoch is 6.4 minutes; which comprises 32 slots or blocks (1 slot = 1 block). Do you recall that different blockchain protocols have different epochs wherein validators propose and attest (vote) to reach a consensus? Cardano, for instance, has a five-day epoch, while Solana's epoch is 44 hours. Ethereum's current epoch is tagged finalized after two more epochs are recorded behind it and Ethereum using a different metric like epoch, as opposed to blocks, is tied to its current transfer from a proof of work consensus to a proof of stake consensus.</p>
